\subsection{Theorems}

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]
  \label{pythagorean}
  This is a theorem about right triangles and can be summarised in the next
  equation
  \[ x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
  Given two line segments whose lengths are \(a\) and \(b\) respectively there is a
  real number \(r\) such that \(b=ra\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  To prove it by contradiction try and assume that the statement is false,
  proceed from there and at some point you will arrive to a contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}[Fibration]
  A fibration is a mapping between two topological spaces that has the homotopy lifting property for every space \(X\).
\end{definition}

Unnumbered theorem-like environments are also possible.

\begin{remark}
  This statement is true, I guess.
\end{remark}
